**\# TITLE:** From IT Tickets to Intelligent Enterprise: ServiceNow's AI Journey

**\## Homework submission from Ingrid Blankevoort**

**\## Overview and Origin**

- Name of company: ServiceNow
- When was the company incorporated? 2004
- Who are the founders of the company?
  - Frederic B Luddy was the original founder and CTO. Other original founders: David Loo. Don Goodliffe, Bow Ruggeri, and Patrick Casey
  - In 2019, Bill McDermott has succeeded as the new ServiceNow CEO and had led the company since then.
- How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? Fred Luddy had 30 years of software development experience when he was the CTO for Peregrine Systems. In 2003, Peregrine Systems went defunct and Luddy left. He strongly believed that enterprise software was inefficient, too complex, and difficult to use. He founded Glidesoft, which later became ServiceNow. His idea and vision were to create a cloud-based ticketing system that would help IT departments track and manage their work without extensive training, easy to use and scalable, yet affordable compared to the existing solutions.
- How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? ServiceNow was funded in 2006 when venture financing JMI Equity invested $2.5M to allow Fred hired five additional employees. That’s when the company’s name changed from Glidesoft to ServiceNow.

**\## Business Activities**

- What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?  
    ServiceNow solves the headache of managing work across large organizations by replacing manual, inefficient processes, messy paperwork utilizing email chains and manual spreadsheets with a single automated digital workflows platform. What started as a simple IT help desk tool has grown into a powerful platform that uses AI to help employees across any department get their work done faster and smarter.
- Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

\- Organizations undergoing digital transformation

\- Total addressable market: $175 billion by 2024

\- Current reach: 80% of Fortune 500 companies

\- Active enterprise customers: 7,700+ globally

\- Geographical presence: 85+ countries

This focused list captures the most significant aspects of ServiceNow's customer base and their primary market opportunities. The company's ability to serve these key industries has been crucial to their growth from a simple IT ticketing system to a comprehensive enterprise platform.

- What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)  
    ServiceNow’s is famous for it’s “one platform” approach, where everything runs on a single system instead of multiple sources. ServiceNow also has a no-code or low-code capabilities for users to create custom applications without extensive programming knowledge, which makes it more flexible and accessible than other competitor’s solutions. In 2017, ServiceNow began its significant AI journey and added machine learning capabilities for basic automation and production. Fast forward in 2023, ServiceNow partnered with NVIDIA for generative AI capabilities and in 2024 ServiceNow continue expanding their AI offerings for practical daily business operations.
- Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)  
    In the past two years (2023-2024), ServiceNow has significantly advanced its technology stack by integrating generative AI through their "Now Assist" platform, which uses large language models to automate complex tasks and provide intelligent responses across their entire suite of products. The company partnered with NVIDIA to enhance their AI capabilities, implementing features like text-to-code generation, automated workflow suggestions, and intelligent virtual agents that can understand and respond to natural language requests more effectively. ServiceNow's platform is built on a cloud-native architecture using modern technologies like Kubernetes for container orchestration, React for front-end development, and a microservices architecture that allows for scalable, flexible deployment of their AI-powered services. In early 2024, they further expanded their AI capabilities by introducing more sophisticated machine learning models for predictive analytics and process optimization, while maintaining their commitment to low-code/no-code development that allows customers to easily customize and implement AI solutions without deep technical expertise.

**\## Landscape**

- What field is the company in?  
    Previously ServiceNow was known as IT ticketing system company. Now it is becoming Enterprise Software focused on Cloud Computing, SaaS, and AI-powered Business Solutions

**\## Results**

    ServiceNow has made a huge impact by helping large companies transform their redundant, manual work processes into smooth digital experiences, now serving 80% of Fortune 500 companies and generating over $8.5 billion in revenue by 2023.

Their success in simplifying work processes has made them a vital tool for modern businesses, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic when companies needed to quickly shift to digital and remote work solutions.

- How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?  
    At this moment, ServiceNow is the market leader and the #1 IT Service Management company in the world. It has the fastest growing enterprise software company of its size.

**\## Recommendations**

- If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
  - More affordable pricing tiers (currently Service Now has no free trial)
  - Offer smaller or simplified integration for small business solutions in addition to the current Enterprise solution
  - Mobile device friendly
- Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

It will tap many more small/medium business markets that remains untapped and will expand their market reach even more. It will also enlarge the market share of ServiceNow and potentially be the one stop solution for all kinds of businesses in resource planning, onboarding, and project implementation.

- What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Continue integration with deeper generative AI capabilities (LLM, Machine Learning, NLP and Advanced Analytics) across all markets and services.

- Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

ServiceNow's AI integration strategy is crucial as it strengthens their position as a one-stop enterprise solution provider. By embedding AI across their unified platform, they can offer smarter automation, predictive analytics, and intelligent workflows - all within a single ecosystem. This comprehensive AI-powered approach not only keeps them ahead of competitors but also delivers on their promise of being the single platform that businesses need for all their digital workflow needs.

This positioning is powerful because:

- It builds on their existing strength as a unified platform
- Makes AI accessible and practical for everyday business operations
- Reduces the need for customers to seek multiple vendors
- Creates a stronger competitive advantage in the enterprise software market
